## 💡 Quick Examples

### Basic SELECT Query
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, email
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'USA'
ORDER BY last_name;
```

### JOIN Operation
```sql
SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name, orders.order_date
FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
```

### Aggregate Functions
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_orders, SUM(amount) as total_sales
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2025-01-01';
```
